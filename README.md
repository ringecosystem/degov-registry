# DeGov Registry

This registry contains a list of DAOs that utilize DeGov as their governance framework, and are featured on the [https://apps.degov.ai](https://apps.degov.ai) page. DeGov is an open-source framework, so anyone can use it to build their own DAO. If you've built a DAO using DeGov, feel free to submit a pull request to add it to this registry.

This registry also hosts brand assets for DAOs and tokens that use DeGov. If you have brand assets you'd like to include, please submit a pull request.
